<h3>About Me</h3>
<p id=me>I was born in Honolulu, Hawaii. At the time I had a cat named Tommy. He was adorable. Then my family moved to Florida, still had Tommy. After Florida, it was Maryland, then California. In California, we got another cat named Tina. She was not a cat but an alien in a cat suit! She would hunt and then stack her prey in a triangle behind the grill. My mom got Toby after my dad took out trees in our yard. Then, me being a cat lover, incase you haven't noticed I love cats, I went to a pet store and called my mom to get another kitten. Her name is Tessa but my family calles her Tessie, Tessarack, Tessarack-a-woo-woo. Cute names I know. My favorite color is purple and my favorite animal is Cats. I love all fluffy cats. Hairless cats freak me out and I hope the best for them.</p>

<h3>About my family</h3>
<p id=family>My Mother's name is JoAnn and my father's name is Joseph. My mom went to college to be in denistry and my dad went into the navy. Now my dad is a computer scientist. I have a single brother named Matthew who is 22 and goes to East Carolina University. He has a computer science degree. My family really likes computer science since 3/4 will have that degree. I have four pets, Toby, Mitch, Tessa, and Tessa's Dinner. I call my fish TD for short. My dog is a white german shepherd and my dad said getting him was the happiest day of his life. This was why I got the kitten without his permission since me being born should of been the happiest day of his life.</p>

<h3>What I hope to do with my life</h3>
<p id=plans>When I graduate, I hope I can get a job with AI or web development. I really enjoy working with Alexa and designing website. My first website was about cats(not a shock honestly) I hope to find a nice person to marry, maybe, and maybe have kids when I'm not allergic to them anymore.</p>
